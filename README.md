ðŸ“š Book Management RESTful API

Welcome to the **Book Management System** â€“ a simple yet powerful **Spring Boot** application that provides complete **CRUD operations** for managing books through a RESTful API.
This project demonstrates how to build scalable and maintainable backend services using real-world entity modeling (Book), REST principles, and **Spring Boot with MySQL**. Itâ€™s ideal for library systems, bookstore platforms, or any application that requires book inventory management.
With clearly defined endpoints and layered architecture (Controller â†’ Service â†’ Repository), this API is designed for both learning and production use.

ðŸ’¡ Core Functionalities

- âœ… Add a new book
- âœ… Retrieve all books
- âœ… Get book details by ID
- âœ… Update book information
- âœ… Delete a book
- âœ… Well-documented RESTful endpoints

Use this as a standalone backend or integrate it with any frontend (Angular, React, etc.). Great for beginners and intermediate developers looking to master API development with Spring Boot.
